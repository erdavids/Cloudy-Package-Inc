A fun simple game I made in 72 hours using Godot Engine and decided to make open source. Hopefully the game will be fun to play but also serve as a resource for anyone that wants to learn more about game development.

You can play the game and learn more about the rules [on the Itch.io page](https://thebuffed.itch.io/cloudy-package-inc).

Additionally, I am working on [a series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD6pLkSpTUA) about the development of this game that you can check out if you're interested. 

This project may appear simple but it contains a lot of examples that cover many areas of developing a game with Godot. If you have any questions
